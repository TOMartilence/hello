But Id need nothing less than the worlds strongest coder. I know its a lot to ask given that your hard work is impeccable but lets work together to make ends meet. As we have just now set sail more and more people will join our crew so I want you to be ready to rule the world we will build together. Above all you will indeed be one of the freest men alive and we will rule the seas together.
